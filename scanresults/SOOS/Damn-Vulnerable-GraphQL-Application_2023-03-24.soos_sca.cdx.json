It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]PreambleThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.Also, for each distributor\u0027s protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don\u0027t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \u0022work based on the library\u0022 and a \u0022work that uses the library\u0022. The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \u0022this License\u0022). Each licensee is addressed as \u0022you\u0022.A \u0022library\u0022 means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.The \u0022Library\u0022, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \u0022work based on the Library\u0022 means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0022modification\u0022.)\u0022Source code\u0022 for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0027s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \u0022work that uses the Library\u0022. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.However, linking a \u0022work that uses the Library\u0022 with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \u0022work that uses the library\u0022. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.When a \u0022work that uses the Library\u0022 uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \u0022work that uses the Library\u0022 with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\u0027s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \u0022work that uses the Library\u0022, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.For an executable, the required form of the \u0022work that uses the Library\u0022 must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0027 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0022any later version\u0022, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.NO WARRANTY15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \u0022AS IS\u0022 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONSHow to Apply These Terms to Your New LibrariesIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u0022copyright\u0022 line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     one line to give the library\u0027s name and an idea of what it does.     Copyright (C) year  name of author     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

In each case subsection 3.3      shall apply.      You may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to      the corresponding Covered Source as modified by You and You may      add additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.      Including Covered Source in a larger work is modifying the      Covered Source, and the larger work becomes modified Covered      Source.  3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You      shall also become a Licensor) provided that You:       a) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2;       b) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You          have modified it, with the date and brief description of how          You have modified it;       c) add a Source Location Notice for the modified Covered Source          if You Convey in circumstances where the recipient does not          otherwise receive a copy of the modified Covered Source; and       d) license the modified Covered Source under the terms and          conditions of this Licence (or, as set out in subsection          8.3, a later version, if permitted by the licence of the          original Covered Source). Such modified Covered Source must          be licensed as a whole, but excluding Available Components          contained in it, which remain licensed under their own          applicable licences.4 Making and Conveying ProductsYou may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You eitherprovide each recipient with a copy of the Complete Source or ensurethat each recipient is notified of the Source Location of the CompleteSource. That Complete Source is Covered Source, and You mustaccordingly satisfy Your obligations set out in subsection 3.3. Ifspecified in a Notice, the Product must visibly and securely displaythe Source Location on it or its packaging or documentation in themanner specified in that Notice.5 Research and DevelopmentYou may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products toa legal entity carrying out development, testing or quality assurancework on Your behalf provided that the work is performed on terms whichprevent the entity from both using the Source or Products for its owninternal purposes and Conveying the Source or Products or anymodifications to them to any person other than You.

The Licensor makes no      representation that any Source or Product does not or will not      infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other      proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and      performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not      the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part      of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights      granted under this Licence.  6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to      the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for      direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,      punitive or other damages of any character including, without      limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of      use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused      and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including      negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way      in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source      and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of      the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the      Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs,      damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties,      in relation to such use.7 Patents  7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each      Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as      stated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4) patent license to Make, have      Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer      the Covered Source and Products, where such licence applies only      to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are      necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered      Source as Conveyed by that Licensor.  7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including      a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the      Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory      patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent      licensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable      then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall      terminate as of the date such process is initiated.8 General  8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become      invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining      provisions shall remain effective.  8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and      abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is      known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where      the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use      shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind      of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or      its personnel.  8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence      which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may      differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New      versions will be published with a unique version number and a      variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has      specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source      without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source      as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that      variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be      treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may      also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific      version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You      may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same      variant identifier published by CERN.  8.4 This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail      to comply with any of its terms and conditions.  8.5 However, if You cease all breaches of this Licence, then Your      Licence from any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has      terminated this Licence by giving You, while You remain in      breach, a notice specifying the breach and requiring You to cure      it within 30 days, and You have failed to come into compliance      in all material respects by the end of the 30 day period. Should      You repeat the breach after receipt of a cure notice and      subsequent reinstatement, this Licence will terminate      immediately and permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply      after any termination.  8.6 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor      acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are      specifically excluded."

      "description": "The urllib3 library 1.26.x before 1.26.4 for Python omits SSL certificate validation in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies.
